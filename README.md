# CrushTheCrave 
"The average young adult takes as many as 30 days to quit smoking, and the hardest part is doing it alone. Now you don't have to. 
Introducing Crush the Crave, a mobile app designed by the Propel Centre for Population Health Impact at the University of Waterloo. 
Developed in partnership with Leave the Pack Behind (www.ltpb.org), Crush the Crave is a FREE, easy-to-use and intelligent android 
app that helps you stop smoking and start living a healthy life. It also includes the option to insert and tag your locations on a map. 
Whether you're quitting cold turkey or committing to a tailored Quit Plan, Crush the Crave helps you by tracking progress and 
reminding you of how much money you've saved and how much your health has improved. These milestones are tracked as rewards, which 
you can choose to share with your social network and rally support from friends and family. Additional features include tools for
distracting the crave, Tag Me, and a Leader Board that allows you to see progress compared to others who are trying to quit. 
Crush the Crave also contains links to community resources such as quitlines as well as helpful information and advice on what to 
expect while quitting smoking and quit aids. Quitting doesn’t have to be hard. Crush the Crave, you’re not alone."
